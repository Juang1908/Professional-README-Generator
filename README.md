### Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it's important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it , how to report issuses, and how to make contributions-this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. By using this app, you can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.
